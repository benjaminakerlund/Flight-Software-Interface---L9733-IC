/*Proposal of an interface for a driver of the L9733 IC
Version: 1.0
Author: Benjamin Ã…kerlund, May 2021
The L9733 IC may be controlled with an MCU over the SPI-bus, using its definition of input pins:
[MOSI = DI, MISO = DO, CLK = SCLK, SS = CS]
.

//Section 1: Data structures and Macro Declarations

/*
 This Data Structure would hold information on which output pins (OUT1-8) are active, or HIGH, constantly.
 The data structure may be used when only changing the state of one output pin, and afterwards updating the status
 of the pins. The structure has three different components, each for the different mode of functionality for the IC.
 Eg. ActiveProtect would store information of which output pins have the overcurrent protection enabled, in form of a
 "8-bit integer" such as 00100001. In this example, the third (3.) and last (8.) output pin would be set as HIGH.
 */
typedef struct {
    int ActiveProtect;
    int ActiveDiag;
    int ActiveOutput;
} Status;


/*
 These Macros contain often used information when sending data to the IC. In every 16-bit segment of data sent,
 the ADDRESS will always be set as 1010. Otherwise communication won't happen. The corresponding keywords used to
 select the functionality mode of the IC are then PROTECT for overcurrent protection, DIAG for diagnostics and
 OUTPUT for changing the state of the output pins (OUT1-8)
 */
#define ADDRESS 1010
#define PROTECT 1010
#define DIAG 0011
#define OUTPUT 1100



//SECTION 2: Functions allowing Data to be sent to IC
/*These function will combine the Address and Keyword (corresponding to the writing mode of the IC) with the "Drive Mode"
of the output pins (OUT1-8) into the correct 16-bit format as well as reverse the order either via spi.h or locally,
in order to send the LSB first, before finally sending the data to the ICs DI pin. The functions might then check the status of eg. the overcurrent protected
output pins (using the Status structure) and change the state, if the selected pin is not already in that state.*/

/*
 Enable or Disable overcurrent protection for one output pin (OUT1-8) to the wanted state. The function takes as input
 which pin to enable the protection for from in the format of an integer, where 1 is the first
 output pin (OUT1), 2 would be the second output pin (OUT2)... and so on.
 Secondly the function takes the wanted state of 0 or 1 as input.
 */
int setProtection(int pin, bool state);

/*
 Enable or Disable diagnostic data to be returned to the Master/Controller from one output pin (OUT1-8).
 The function takes as input which pin to enable the protection for from in the format of an integer,
 where 1 is the first output pin (OUT1), 2 would be the second output pin (OUT2)... and so on.
 Secondly the function takes the wanted state of 0 or 1 as input.

 */
int setDiagnostics(int pin, bool state);

/*
 Sets the output pins to HIGH or LOW (0 or 1).
 The function takes as input which pin to enable the protection for from in the format of an integer,
 where 1 is the first output pin (OUT1), 2 would be the second output pin (OUT2)... and so on.
 Secondly the function takes the wanted state of 0 or 1 as input.
 */
int setOutput(int pin, bool state);

/*
 This function could be used to change the state of multiple pins at once. The function would call on the above
 declared functions multiple times, for each output pin (OOT1-7). The function might take as input the wanted writing MODE
 as integers, where 1 might represent Overcurrent protection, 2 might represent Diagnostic mode and 3, respectively Output mode.
 The next input would be an 8-bit segment indicating which pins the user wants to set as HIGH (1) and which ones as LOW (0).
 This bit might look as follows 00100001. For this case the third and last bit would then be set as 1 in the wanted mode.
 */
int setMultiplePins(int MODE, int pinStates)



//Section 3: Initialising SPI-communication and other functions
/*This segments contains additional functions that may be useful for driving the L9733 IC. In fact the init() function
is essential for driving the IC, and must always be executed first.
 */

/*
 The init() function may be used to initialize the SPI-communication for the master and slave (controller and IC).
 Before this, the pins required by the peripheral interface of the L9733 are usually defined to the controllers pins.
 Such as: SCLK, DO, DI, CS
 .
 init() would often use the pinMode() function from the spi.h library, and would often define the ChipSelect pin,
 set it to HIGH or 1 to signify not sending any data yet, and initiate the clock-signal.
 The init() function could return a boolean value of TRUE or FALSE (1 or 0) as to indicate whether or not the initialisation
 has succeeded. There may also be checks or error handling in place.
 */
bool init();

/*
 Alike the a functions declared in Section 2, this function would allow for sending the same data to multiple (if not all)
 connected peripheral ICs. This may be useful in the case of multiple connected ICs for more complex or dynamic systems.
 The function might simply call a in Section 2 declared function, after first setting the additional IC's CS pin to logical 0.
 The MODE could be set to represent eg: [1 = Protection, 2 = Diagnostic, 3 = Output]. The function needs no inputs, since these
 would already be made when calling the section 2 functions.
 .
 This function is unnecessary if only one IC is utilized.
*/
int setMultiple();

/*
 This is an extra function, which may be beside the point of this assignment, but I thought I would include it anyway.
 The L9733 has three input pins (IN6-8), which when activated allow for sending PWM signal from the OUT6-8 pins. This
 may be useful in certain driver applications. However this functionality occurs despite the status of the SPI command
 register and is therefore outside of the SPI-bus. The function takes as an input the wanted pin out of the (IN6-8) and
 switches on pulse width modulation for that output pin (OUT6-8).
